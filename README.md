# Coding Standards

This repo holds the coding standards for any Typescript project managed by the SafelyTyped community.

Feel free to adopt them for your own community too :)

## Introduction

### Why Do We Need Coding Standards At All?

_Written coding standards_ are designed to _ensure an acceptable level of consistent software quality_ across our projects.

That's doing a lot of heavy lifting. Let's break it down.

* The whole point of the _SafelyTyped_ projects is to give you tools to raise the quality of your software.
* To achieve that, we believe it's important that all of our code is written, tested and documented to (at least!) the same standard.
* We don't believe that it's possible to achieve consistency unless that standard itself has been documented in a way that's easy to understand.

Even in an office environment - where people can quickly and easily discuss things face-to-face - they are helpful. On a distributed project - where discussions don't happen in real-time, and where contributors can be infrequent - they are essential.

### Where Do These Standards Come From?

They're based on the approach that Stuart has developed and refined over the last 25 years of working on software quality and assurance.
