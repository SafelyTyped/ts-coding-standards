# Command/Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)

_Command/query responsibility segregation_ (_CQRS_ for short) is a software architecture technique. It's a term that's become very overloaded. Here, we are concerned only with the underlying principle.

The basic premise is that a function's purpose must be either:

* create, update, or delete data, or
* query data

The same function is not allowed to have more than one purpose.

* Functions that create, update or delete data _are_ allowed to call functions that query data, but
* functions that query data are **not** allowed to call any functions that create, update or delete data

_CQRS_ has the explicit guarantee that a query never changes the state of your application - either in memory, or of any persistent data (ie your database).

(Logs, metrics and other reporting data is not considered to be application state. Under _CQRS_, query functions are allowed to create logs, metrics and the like.)

_CQRS_ is one of the fundamental ways to avoid [side effects][Side Effects] in your code.
