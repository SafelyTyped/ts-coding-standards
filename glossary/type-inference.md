# Type Inference

_Type inference_ is where the compiler can work out the type of a variable, generic parameter, and/or return type for you.

For example:

```typescript
// the compiler can tell that `input` is a string
// without us having to explicitly say so
const input = "hello world!";
```

When it works, _type inference_ speeds up the process of writing code, because we don't have to take the time to explicitly say what type something is.

We say "when it works", because the Typescript compiler is written to be fast first, and complete second. The _type inference_ algorithm will bail if it thinks it'll take too much time to work. That said, the compiler developers do keep adding more and more _type inference_ support.

In theory, it can go wrong as well :)

The main problem with _type inference_ is that relying on it is a form of _happy path development_.

* If you're not adding types to your code, you might not spot where you've written code to call the wrong function or method.
* The compiler can't do that for you, because it doesn't know which types you _meant_ to use.

You're effectively using the compiler on auto-pilot, and hoping for the best.
