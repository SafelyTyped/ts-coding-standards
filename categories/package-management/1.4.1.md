## Description

Do not ship any code that isn't for production use.

By _ship_, we mean include that code in a package available from the NPM public repository or equivalent.

Non-production code includes:

* unit tests
* fixtures for unit tests
* example code
* development dependencies

and anything else that isn't either part of the package's public API, or called by the package's public API.

You can put any non-production code into a folder that starts with an underscore. It'll compile as normal during your development work, and will be stripped out of the `lib/` folder during the packaging stage.

## Discussion

### Not All Code Belongs On A Server

We need to be careful about what we include in a package.

Security exploits sometimes rely on code that was never designed to be on someone's server somewhere. If we don't ship this kind of code, we're reducing the attack surface.

### If We Ship It, Someone Will Rely On It

[End-users][End-User] have no sure-fire way to tell whether or not packaged code is part of the public API or not. If it's there, their IDE will almost certainly tell them that it's there.

There's only one way to make sure [end-users][End-User] don't come to rely on code that we never intended them to have: don't ship it in the first place.
