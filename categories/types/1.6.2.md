## Description

Every instantiable type must have a type guard.

An _instantiable type_ is a type that the end-user can create objects from. This includes:

* all branded and flavoured types
* all classes that aren't base classes

A _type guard_ is a Typescript function that returns a _type predicate_. We use these to tell the Typescript compiler which type we are working with.
