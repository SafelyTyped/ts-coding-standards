## Description

Do not create static factory methods.

Create `makeXXX()` smart constructor functions instead.

A _static factory method_ is a `static` method on a class. They normally call a `protected constructor`.

## Discussion

### The Pattern Isn't Possible In Javascript

Static factory methods are normally used to provide the [caller][Caller] with ways to create an object from several alternative sets of inputs. Static factory methods call a permissive, `protected constructor`. The `constructor` is `protected` because it's normally dumb and/or accepts a complex (or confusing) set of inputs.

We simply can't implement the static factory method pattern in the same way that you might be used to in other languages.

We have a Javascript runtime-engine limitation that every instantiable class has to have a `public constructor`. Our `public constructor`s _have_ to be [smart constructors][Smart Constructor], otherwise they're not safe.

### DRYing Out The Code

We have a project convention that there's a `makeXXX()` smart constructor for every instantiable type. These do the same conceptual job as _static factory methods_. They're just not defined as class properties.

There's no benefit here in having two sets of code that do the exact same thing.

* If we had both, which one should users call? How would they decide?
* If we had both, we'd have to maintain the code for both. And we'd probably have to insist on implementing both for all types.
* `makeXXX()` smart constructors can be created for all types; _static factory methods_ can only be created for types that have classes.

It's better that we just have the one way of doing this.
