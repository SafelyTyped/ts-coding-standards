## Description

All code must have 100% code coverage.

* 100% line coverage
* 100% branch coverage

We use [`nyc`](https://istanbul.js.org/) for our code coverage metrics.

## Discussion

### Why 100% Code Coverage?

It's the reason why we call them _safe types_. They're _safe_ because they deliver guarantees about the data that each type holds. And we know they're safe because they're well-tested.

### I'm Struggling To Reach 100% Code Coverage

If you've got code that seems unreachable, you probably need to add in a [mandatory dependency][Mandatory Dependency].

Unreachable code normally exists to handle rare (or possibly even future) error conditions.

For example, if you use a regex that includes _named groups_, you can't access any of the _named groups_ until you've convinced the Typescript compiler that the groups are there.

That's an `if` statement that will work 100% of the time, but without it, your code will not compile. How do you test that?

The way to test that is to make the regex a [mandatory dependency][Mandatory Dependency], and then wrap the whole thing in an arrow function. That way, your unit test can pass in a different regex to trigger the error condition, and there's no risk of production code using the wrong regex.

### Help! My Code Relies On External Services

If you've writing tests for code that relies on a database, API, or anything at all that's outside the codebase, there's a couple of options available:

1. Use a different third-party library, one that supports _interceptors_ or other mechanisms to help you with unit testing.
2. Pass in a _mock_ as a [mandatory dependency][Mandatory Dependency].

Only resort to _mocks_ when there's no other way to achieve 100% code coverage.
