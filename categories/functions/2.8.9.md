## Description

Functional options must be captured as a rest parameter.

Functional options are the final parameters in [our standard function signature][2.8.1]. They are normally expressed as:

```typescript
function myFunc(
    input: IN,
    { }: MyOptions,
    ...fnOpts: FunctionalOption<OUT>[]
): OUT { ... }
```

## Discussion

### Rest Parameters Will Be Used In Other Languages

It's our ambition to provide safe types for other languages. Where it makes sense to do so, we want safe types to look and work the same across all our supported languages.

In some of those languages, such as Golang, the only way we'll be able to support _functional options_ will be as a rest parameter.

We've decided to do the same with Typescript, even though other approaches are available.

### Rest Parameters Make Code Easier To Read

Our background reading has left us with the impression that people find rest parameters easier to read than the alternatives.
