## Description

Docblocks must begin with the name of the item they document.

## Discussion

This is taken from [Golang's Style Guide](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html).

Having worked with Golang for several years, we believe that this does a great job of making the docblock easy to read no matter where it appears:

- as a tooltip in the IDE
- in auto-generated reference documentation
- cut and pasted into tutorial documentation

## Examples

This example shows how a docblock should look.

```typescript
/**
 * `Value` describes the behaviour of data that does have a value,
 * but does not have an identity (a primary key).
 *
 * It is useful for ensuring all value objects have a *minimal* set
 * of common behaviour, whether or not they share a common base class.
 *
 * Use {@link Entity} for data that does have an identity.
 *
 * @category Archetypes
 * @template T the type that is wrapped
 */
export interface Value<T> {
    /**
     * `implementsValue()` is a type-guard.
     *
     * It was added to help the `isValue()` type guard function.
     */
    implementsValue(): this is Value<T>;

    /**
     * `valueOf()` returns the wrapped value.
     *
     * For types passed by reference, we do NOT return a clone of any kind.
     * You have to be careful not to accidentally change this value.
     *
     * @returns the wrapped value
     */
    valueOf(): T;
}
