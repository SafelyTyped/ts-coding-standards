## Description

All names must be racially-neutral.

This covers:

- all class names
- all constant names
- all function names
- all interface names
- all method names
- all type names
- all variable names

without exception.

We'll add specific guidance to cover common terms to the [Naming Conventions][naming-conventions] category. Look for them there, and if anything is missing, please open an issue so that we can address it.

## Discussion

Terms like `blacklist` are deeply offensive to millions of people. It isn't important whether or not those terms originated in racially-charged language. It isn't important if they're the de facto jargon in our industry. They have _become_ racially-charged.

And they have to go.

It helps to remove the association that "black is bad" / "white is good". It helps to prevent implicit bias now and in the future. It helps people who live their lives on the receiving end of racial abuse and discrimination.

Before you reach for phrases like "social justice warriors", "woke", or "virtue signalling", ask yourself this: why do you feel threatened by this? Replacing these terms is not a threat to you at all. You may have been brought up to feel differently. That may not be your fault.

How you continue to react - that _is_ within your control.

If you want to contribute to this project, your work will be in the same melting pot as work from people with a different gender, different sexual orientation, different ethnicity, and different life experience.

If you think that any of these differences somehow makes your work more important than them, we're not the project for you.
