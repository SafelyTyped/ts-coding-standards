## Description

All smart constructors must be prefixed with `makeXXX()`.

(Replace the `XXX` with the rest of the name of your function!)

A _smart constructor_ is a function, method, or class constructor that creates a smart type. It does this by validating the input data, and rejecting invalid values.

Do not use the `make` prefix for any other kinds of functions.

### Using Function Prefixes To Speed Up Development

Need to create a type, but you can't remember its full name?

Simply type `make` in your IDE, and it will list all of the functions that it knows about. And that's often enough.
