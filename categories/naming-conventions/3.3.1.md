## Description

Every function or method must start with `<verb><noun>`.

Do not create functions or methods that don't have a verb in their name at all.

## Discussion

The basic premise here is that source code should be as readable as possible to as many people as possible.

To support that, we need to make the purpose of every function or method as clear as we can:

* We add a verb to the front of each function or method to explain what operation it performs (e.g. `get`, `set`, `is`)
* We add a noun immediately after the verb to explain what the operation is performed on.

## Exceptions

The only exceptions allowed are where a class or interface is implementing an already well-established Javascript structure. As these crop up, they will be documented here.

**Treat this as an exhaustive list in your code reviews**.

* `ValueObject.valueOf()` - `.valueOf()` is a standard Javascript convention to get the value of an object.

## Examples

* `makeHttpStatusCodeFrom()`
* `isString()`
* `validateUnion()`
* `Filepath.getPathApi()`
