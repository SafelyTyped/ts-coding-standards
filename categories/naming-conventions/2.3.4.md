## Description

All type guards must be prefixed with `mustBeXXX()`.

(Replace the `XXX` with the rest of the name of your function!)

A _type guarantee_ is a function that throws an `Error` if the input doesn't have a compatible type. We call them to improve the robustness of our code.

Do not use the `mustBe` prefix for any other kinds of functions.

## Discussion

### Keeping Things Consistent

If all of our _type guarantees_ start with the same prefix, you don't have to guess which function to call when you need a type guarantee.
