## Description

All functions and methods that return a function must be called `buildXXX()`.

(Replace the `XXX` with the rest of your function name!)

Do not use the `build` prefix for any other kind of function or method.

Simply type `build` in your IDE, and it will list all of the functions that it knows about. And that's often enough.
