## Description

All type guards must be prefixed with `isXXX()`.

(Replace the `XXX` with the rest of the name of your function!)

A _type guard_ is a function that returns a _type predicate_. We use them in Typescript code to tell the compiler which operations are safe to perform on any piece of data of indeterminate type.

Do not use the `is` prefix for any other kinds of functions.

## Discussion

### Keeping Things Consistent

If all of our _type guards_ start with the same prefix, you don't have to guess which function to call when you need a type guard.
