## Description

Every protocol interface must define an `implementsXXX()` method.

Interfaces tend to fall into one of these (non-exhaustive!) categories:

* Something that's meant to be implemented by a class (aka [a protocol][Protocol]), or
* Something that describes the data structure of a plain Typescript object (a _data bag_), or
* A workaround for Typescript's lack of nominal typing.

Any interface that falls into the first category must define an `implementsXXX()` method, where `XXX` is the name of the interface.  This method must always return `true`.

## Discussion

### Interfaces Disappear At Runtime

We want to make our code as reusable as possible. Our preferred way to do that is to create interfaces that describe small chunks of functionality - known as _protocols_ - and then write functions and methods that look for these _protocols_, instead of looking for whole classes using the `typeof` operator.

These [protocols][Protocol] and [extensions][Extension] can then be created, shipped and maintained as separate modules, either in the [end-user][End-User]'s app, or as separate library packages.

There's just one problem with that.

Interfaces in Typescript are a little different to interfaces in most other programming languages. They only exist at compile-time. You can't use them in runtime code (ie in type guards) to determine if an object supports the protocol you want or not.

To get around that, we add an `implementsXXX()` method to each of these interfaces. That allows us to write type guards that quickly check whether this method exists or not. If it doesn't, it can bail straight away, without having to continue with more expensive checks.

## How Does This Differ From / Overlap With 3.6.1?

This coding standard means the same thing as [3.6.1][3.6.1]. So why duplicate it here?

Coding standard [3.6.1][3.6.1] covers [all interfaces][types], whether or not they're formally part of a _protocol and extensions set_. It's a Minor requirement for all code across our projects.

When we started to populate the [Protocols and Extensions coding standards][protocols-extensions], we decided that it needed to be a Major requirement in this context. We also decided to change some of the wording to be clearer in this context.
