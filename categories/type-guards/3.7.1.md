## Description

Every type guard must have a unit test that proves it is a _type predicate_.

A _type predicate_ tells the Typescript compiler whether or not the type guard's input parameter is a given type. End-users rely on correctly-functioning type guards to avoid using `as XXX` type casts in their code.

## Discussion

The code inside a type guard returns `true` or `false`. It's the return type of the function or method that makes it a _type predicate_. It's an easy mistake to set the return type to just a `boolean` instead of `input is T`.

Our unit tests are there to help us catch mistakes, both now and in the future.

For the unit test to work, you need to do these things:

1. make sure you have an input of unknown type (otherwise step 3 won't catch mistakes)
2. call the type guard as part of an `if` statement,
3. on success, access a property on the input value

If the type guard has the wrong return type, the unit test will refuse to compile.

## Example

Here's an example taken from [`@safelytyped/core-types`](https://github.com/SafelyTyped/ts-core-types/).

```typescript
    it("is a type predicate", () => {
        const inputValue = "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000";
        const expectedValue = inputValue;

        const unit = ExampleValue.from(inputValue) as unknown;
        let actualValue = "FAILED!!!";
        if (isValue(unit)) {
            // this does not compile if isValue() is not a type-predicate!
            actualValue = unit.valueOf();
        }

        expect(actualValue).to.equal(expectedValue);
    });
```
